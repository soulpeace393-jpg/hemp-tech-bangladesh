Bangladesh’s first Hemp Tech Research Platform (Policy + Textile + Data)

Hemp Tech Bangladesh Research Platform
Bangladesh’s first founder-led open research platform for hemp policy, textile innovation, and data collaboration.

Vision
+**Bangladesh’s first hemp policy + textile research platform.**
+
+We aim to build a trusted, open, and locally grounded research hub that aligns policy progress with industry-ready textile innovation.
+
+## Problem Statement
+Bangladesh has the manufacturing strength and global textile reach to lead in hemp-based materials, yet:
+- **Policy gap:** Clear national guidance for hemp cultivation, licensing, and industrial use is still emerging.
+- **Industry missed potential:** Without trusted research and pilot results, textile stakeholders lack the evidence to invest and innovate.
+
+This platform bridges that gap with open data, policy clarity, and collaborative pilots.
+
+## Features
+- **Fiber database:** Cultivar registry, fiber properties, and processing insights.
+- **Policy dashboard:** Living view of policy drafts, stakeholder feedback, and compliance pathways.
+- **Pilot project map:** Geospatial visibility into trials, processing pilots, and textile prototypes.
+- **Research tools:** Templates, protocols, and open notebooks for hemp research.
+
+## Roadmap
+1. **Student MVP:** Build initial datasets, policy briefs, and proof-of-concept pilots.
+2. **Industry SaaS:** Offer structured dashboards, analytics, and compliance tooling for industry partners.
+3. **Global platform:** Connect Bangladesh’s hemp ecosystem with global research networks and markets.
