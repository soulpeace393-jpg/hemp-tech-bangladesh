# Hemp Tech Research Platform – Bangladesh

## 🌱 Vision
To establish the first integrated Hemp Tech Research Platform in Bangladesh that bridges **policy, academic research, and textile industry innovation**, with a primary focus on industrial hemp fiber and yarn potential.

## 🚨 Problem Statement
In Bangladesh, industrial hemp cultivation remains prohibited due to:
- Policy-level misclassification with narcotic cannabis
- Academic research gaps in hemp fiber and yarn science
- Societal misconceptions equating hemp with drug use

These gaps prevent Bangladesh’s textile and agricultural sectors from accessing a globally growing sustainable fiber industry.
As a result, Bangladesh risks missing a strategic opportunity in sustainable textiles, rural development, and green industrial growth.

## 🎯 Purpose of This Platform
This platform aims to:
- Identify and document **knowledge gaps** surrounding industrial hemp in Bangladesh
- Provide **research-backed evidence** for policy distinction between hemp and narcotic cannabis
- Highlight **textile-grade hemp fiber and yarn potential**
- Serve as a foundation for future **pilot projects, policy briefs, and industrial adoption**

## 🧪 Core Focus Areas
- Industrial Hemp vs Narcotic Cannabis (THC-based distinction)
- Hemp fiber properties and yarn potential
- Comparison with jute and cotton
- Global hemp policy and industry case studies
- Bangladesh-specific opportunities and barriers

## 📚 Methodology (Planned)
- Systematic literature review (academic journals, policy documents)
- Comparative policy analysis (EU, Canada, India, China)
- Textile fiber and yarn performance comparison
- Conceptual machine and processing analysis
- Stakeholder insights (academia, industry, policy)

## 🧩 Expected Outcomes
- Academic thesis and publishable research
- Policy recommendation framework for Bangladesh
- Open research knowledge base on hemp fiber
- Foundation for a national Hemp Tech Research Platform

## 🗺️ Roadmap
**Phase 0:** Idea validation & public documentation  
**Phase 1:** Research & thesis development  
**Phase 2:** Industry-facing knowledge modules  
**Phase 3:** Pilot projects & commercialization pathways

## 👤 Founder
**Name:** Md. Tamim Islam  
**Background:** B.Sc in Textile Engineering 
              (Specialized in Yarn Manufacturing)  
**Focus:** Sustainable fibers, hemp technology, textile innovation  

📅 **Project initiated:** 2026

# Why I am Exploring Industrial Hemp as a Textile Fiber — Not a Drug

Industrial hemp (*Cannabis sativa L.*) has long been misunderstood due to its association with narcotic cannabis. However, industrial hemp is fundamentally different:

- **THC content:** <0.3% (non-intoxicating)
- **Use case:** Fiber, food, construction, biodegradable products
- **Environmental impact:** Low water & pesticide requirement, high CO₂ absorption

## Key Reasons for Exploration

### 1. Sustainability
Hemp requires up to **50% less water than cotton** and absorbs up to **15 tons CO₂ per hectare annually**. These metrics make it a highly sustainable textile raw material.

### 2. Strength & Versatility
Hemp fiber is **stronger and more durable** than cotton, resistant to mold and UV, and ideal for apparel, technical textiles, and industrial applications.

### 3. Environmental Benefits & Circular Economy
Unlike synthetic fibers, hemp is **fully biodegradable**, supporting circular fashion and sustainable production systems.

### 4. Market Opportunity
Global adoption of hemp fiber is rising due to sustainability demands. Brands and industries are increasingly exploring hemp as a **green alternative**.

## Conclusion
Industrial hemp is not a drug — it is a **high-value natural fiber** with significant potential for sustainable textiles, rural livelihoods, and climate-positive industries. This exploration focuses on identifying gaps in knowledge, policy, and industry application, particularly in Bangladesh.
