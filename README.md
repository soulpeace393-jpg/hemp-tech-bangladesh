# Hemp Tech Research Platform – Bangladesh

## 🌱 Vision
To establish the first integrated Hemp Tech Research Platform in Bangladesh that bridges **policy, academic research, and textile industry innovation**, with a primary focus on industrial hemp fiber and yarn potential.

## 🚨 Problem Statement
In Bangladesh, industrial hemp cultivation remains prohibited due to:
- Policy-level misclassification with narcotic cannabis
- Academic research gaps in hemp fiber and yarn science
- Societal misconceptions equating hemp with drug use

These gaps prevent Bangladesh’s textile and agricultural sectors from accessing a globally growing sustainable fiber industry.
As a result, Bangladesh risks missing a strategic opportunity in sustainable textiles, rural development, and green industrial growth.

## 🎯 Purpose of This Platform
This platform aims to:
- Identify and document **knowledge gaps** surrounding industrial hemp in Bangladesh
- Provide **research-backed evidence** for policy distinction between hemp and narcotic cannabis
- Highlight **textile-grade hemp fiber and yarn potential**
- Serve as a foundation for future **pilot projects, policy briefs, and industrial adoption**

## 🧪 Core Focus Areas
- Industrial Hemp vs Narcotic Cannabis (THC-based distinction)
- Hemp fiber properties and yarn potential
- Comparison with jute and cotton
- Global hemp policy and industry case studies
- Bangladesh-specific opportunities and barriers

## 📚 Methodology (Planned)
- Systematic literature review (academic journals, policy documents)
- Comparative policy analysis (EU, Canada, India, China)
- Textile fiber and yarn performance comparison
- Conceptual machine and processing analysis
- Stakeholder insights (academia, industry, policy)

## 🧩 Expected Outcomes
- Academic thesis and publishable research
- Policy recommendation framework for Bangladesh
- Open research knowledge base on hemp fiber
- Foundation for a national Hemp Tech Research Platform

## 🗺️ Roadmap
**Phase 0:** Idea validation & public documentation  
**Phase 1:** Research & thesis development  
**Phase 2:** Industry-facing knowledge modules  
**Phase 3:** Pilot projects & commercialization pathways

## 👤 Founder
**Name:** Md. Tamim Islam  
**Background:** Textile Engineering (Yarn Manufacturing)  
**Focus:** Sustainable fibers, hemp technology, textile innovation
