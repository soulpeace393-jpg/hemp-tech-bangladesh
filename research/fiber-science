# Fiber Science – Industrial Hemp

This domain focuses on the scientific and structural understanding of industrial hemp fiber in comparison with conventional textile fibers.

## Scope

- Botanical classification of industrial hemp (Cannabis sativa L.)
- Bast fiber extraction systems
- Microstructure & cell wall composition
- Mechanical properties comparison (Hemp vs Cotton vs Jute)
- Moisture regain & durability analysis
- Fiber fineness & spinning compatibility

## Research Direction

The objective is to establish a fiber-level technical legitimacy for hemp in textile systems before moving toward yarn and fabric applications.

This section will gradually build structured documentation, literature review mapping, and comparative analysis models.
