## 1.1 Industrial Hemp vs Narcotic Cannabis (Taxonomical Clarification)

Industrial hemp and drug-type cannabis are not separate botanical species but are taxonomically classified within the single species *Cannabis sativa L.*. In their authoritative revision of the genus, Small and Cronquist (1976) proposed a unified species concept recognizing fiber-type and drug-type forms as subspecies within *Cannabis sativa*. This framework remains foundational in contemporary discussions of Cannabis taxonomy.[1.1.1]


The primary distinction between industrial hemp and narcotic cannabis lies in their tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) concentration and intended cultivation purpose (Small, 2015).

Industrial hemp varieties are selectively bred to contain low levels of THC, commonly below 0.3% on a dry-weight basis in jurisdictions such as the United States and Canada, and 0.2%–0.3% within the European Union (European Parliament, 2013; Johnson, 2018). In contrast, narcotic cannabis varieties are cultivated for significantly higher THC content and psychoactive properties (ElSohly et al., 2017).

From an agronomic and morphological perspective, fiber-type hemp plants are generally taller, exhibit reduced branching, and are optimized for bast fiber development and biomass yield (Amaducci et al., 2015). Drug-type varieties are typically shorter, more highly branched, and selectively cultivated to maximize cannabinoid production in flowering tops (Clarke & Merlin, 2013).

These biochemical, genetic, and morphological distinctions form the scientific foundation for differentiated regulatory frameworks in countries that permit industrial hemp cultivation while maintaining strict narcotics control (European Parliament, 2013; Small, 2015).
